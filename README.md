# My JavaScript Learning Journey

I spent 60 days learning JavaScript from scratch. This repo has all my projects.

## What I Built

**Calculator** - Does math operations, tracks history and stats  
**To-Do List** - Add/remove/filter tasks, shows completion percentage  
**Number Game** - Guess the number with hints, 3 difficulty levels  
**String Utils** - 10 functions for text manipulation  
**Array Utils** - 12 functions for array operations  

## What I Learned

Started knowing nothing about programming. Now I can:
- Write functions and loops
- Work with arrays and objects  
- Handle user input
- Debug my own code
- Use Git

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript (Node.js)
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code
