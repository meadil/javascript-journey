# JavaScript Journey 🚀

yo, im adil. 17. learning js from scratch cuz i wanna be a full-stack dev someday 💀

## where im at rn

**Day 33/60** - damn, already more than halfway through month 1!

### what i've done so far

**Week 1** - basics & git
- learned variables, numbers, strings, all that boring stuff
- set up git & github (took forever 💀)
- made a personal info card thing

**Week 2** - if statements & logic
- booleans, comparisons, all that true/false stuff
- if/else chains
- made a number guesser game (kinda fun ngl)

**Week 3** - loops (finally!)
- while loops, for loops
- nested loops were confusing af
- **fizzbuzz challenge** - easier than i thought

**Week 4** - functions
- parameters, return values, scope (scope was weird)
- made a temp converter and bmi calculator
- still confused about when to use return vs console.log sometimes 😑

**Week 5** - arrays (current)
- push, pop, shift, unshift
- indexOf, includes, slice
- looping through arrays
- **just finished day 33** - sum, largest number, count evens. that "second largest" bonus was hard as hell 💀💀

## what's next?
- objects (week 6)
- problem solving stuff
- actual projects (finally!)

## notes
my code is messy as hell but im learning. also i push to github every day cuz why not lol
