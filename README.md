# JavaScript Journey 🚀

yo, im adil. 17. learning js from scratch cuz i wanna be a full-stack dev someday 💀

## where im at rn
**Day 41/60** - just finished week 6 and reflecting on this whole thing

## what i've done so far

### Week 1 - basics & git
* learned variables, numbers, strings, all that boring stuff
* set up git & github (took forever 💀)
* made a personal info card thing

### Week 2 - if statements & logic
* booleans, comparisons, all that true/false stuff
* if/else chains
* made a number guesser game (kinda fun ngl)

### Week 3 - loops (finally!)
* while loops, for loops
* nested loops were confusing af
* fizzbuzz challenge - easier than i thought

### Week 4 - functions
* parameters, return values, scope (scope was weird)
* made a temp converter and bmi calculator
* still confused about when to use return vs console.log sometimes 😑

### Week 5 - arrays
* push, pop, shift, unshift
* indexOf, includes, slice
* looping through arrays
* sum, largest number, count evens. that "second largest" bonus was hard as hell 💀💀
* built a whole grade tracker with functions and everything

### Week 6 - objects (just finished!)
* object basics with dot notation
* object methods (functions inside objects wtf)
* nested objects (objects inside objects inside objects 💀)
* arrays of objects (finally clicked why this is useful)
* **CONTACT BOOK PROJECT** - add/delete/update/search contacts. this was actually sick, felt like building a real app
* made a mega challenge contact manager with all methods in one object

## 🔥 projects completed
1. Personal Info Card
2. Number Guesser Game
3. FizzBuzz Challenge
4. Temperature Converter
5. BMI Calculator
6. Grade Tracker (with average, highest, lowest)
7. **Contact Book Application** (full CRUD - create, read, update, delete)

## what's next?
* week 7 - problem solving patterns & algorithms
* week 8 - calculator & todo list projects
* week 9 - final projects and portfolio polish

## notes
* my code is messy as hell but im learning
* push to github literally every day cuz consistency > perfection
* objects finally make sense after day 40's contact book project
* ready for the problem-solving stuff, sounds fun

**started:** early december 2025  
**goal:** finish by end of january 2026 and move to backend/frontend  
**current streak:** 41 days no skips 💪
